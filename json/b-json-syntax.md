The JSON syntax is a subset of the JavaScript syntax.

JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:
    Data is in name/value pairs
    Data is separated by commas
    Curly braces hold objects
    Square brackets hold arrays

JSON names require double quotes.
In JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes. While In JavaScript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names:

JSON Values
In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

    a string
    a number
    an object

JavaScript Arrays as JSON
The same way JavaScript objects can be written as JSON, JavaScript arrays can also be written as JSON.
